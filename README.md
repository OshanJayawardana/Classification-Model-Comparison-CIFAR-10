# Classification Model Comparison for CFAR-10 Dataset

![cfar-10](https://github.com/OshanJayawardana/Classification-Model-Comparison-CIFAR-10/blob/main/resources/cifar-10.png)

In this project I have trained a `Linear Classifier`, `2 Layer Fully Connected NN` and a `CNN` model to classify images in `CIFAR-10` dataset.
Also I have used several optimization methods and compared their results.

#### Trained Weights of the Linear Classifier

#### Comarison of 2 Layer Fully Connected NN with and without using Stochastic Gradient Descent
